A safe & encrypted place to share files. ðŸŽ€

## Features

- **Ephemeral-first**: All uploads are treated as temporary and will be automatically deleted based on time since last access.

- **Storage-efficient**: All uploads are deduplicated by writing them to disk as `<hash>.<ext>`. Hashes are salted with a persistent key generated on first-time startup.

- **Encrypted at rest**: All uploads are encrypted by the server during upload and the decryption key is sent to the uploader and is not stored by the server, No upload can be accessed without the deceyption key, even with access to the filesystem.
  - Note: as encyption and decryption is handled server-side a malicious actor with access to the server could intercept data unencrypted or log decryption keys. This is a considered flaw thar allows embedding uploads on any website.

- **Configurable and simple**: Running the server should be as simple as pulling the docker container or building the binary, changing a few configuration options, and starting the server.

## Setup

### Docker

1. Copy [compose.yml](./compose.yml) to a local file named `compose.yml` or add the
   service to your existing stack and fill in the environment variables.
   Information about configuration options can be found in the
   [configuration](#configuration) section.

2. Start the stack

```
docker compose up -d
```

### Manual

1. Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed and
   in your `$PATH`.
2. Install the project binary

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/Blooym/dollhouse.git
```

3. Set configuration values as necessary.
   Information about configuration options can be found in the
   [configuration](#configuration) section.

| Upload mimetypes       | File mimetypes that are allowed to be uploaded. Supports type wildcards (e.g. 'image/*', '*/*').
